# librenms-searchendpoint
Simple Python script that gathers and displays information from LibreNMS API and checks for manufacturer via macvendors.com API. 
Allows input of both IP and MAC-address.

Run script directly by entering domain or IP-address after script (eg. ./searchendpoint.py 10.10.10.50) or by running the script and then entering input.

The script will need to be modified with your LibreNMS API-key and FQDN-address to your LibreNMS instance.

Script has been tested with LibreNMS version 22.8.
